    We respond to Mr Honner's challenge with a combination of
    open-source project organization and web technologies. Rather than
    "A full-time staff of professional teachers, mathematicians,
    designers, and editors ..." we turn to the latent potential of
    volunteers, and describe how their efforts can be focused.

    First though, consider the problems with a conventional
    approach. While the costs to run such an organization would
    be __relatively__ inexpensive (compared to the global costs of
    textbooks) this is no guarantee of success.  For instance, the
    Sage project---at least as grand in outlook---has failed to attact
    significant funding even in the face of the overwhelming sum spent
    on commercial software
    ([http://sagemath.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/what-is-sagemathcloud-lets-clear-some.html,link]).

    Furthermore, even with funding, it is arguable whether a
    conventional organization is the best model. Its life will
    *always* be precarious --- from budget to budget --- as financial
    and political winds change. Better to attach, from the outset,
    the success of the project to its grass-roots support.

    The question, then, is not how to attract funding---but how to
    organize the people that are willing to help for free. For
    inspiration consider the develoment of the Linux kernel. Certainly
    there are commercial aspects to Linux---but its continuing success
    has grown from its volunteer community. Furthermore, it is not a
    great leap to recognise in the Linux community---and the broader
    open-source sofware community---the same types of people that
    would be willing to rise to such a Grand Challenge.

    Students, teachers, mathematicians, scientists, engineers, web
    developers and writers should each be able to contrubute
    (according to their interests and abilities) and consume
    (according to their appetites). The technical challenge is to find
    the common ground. Any solutiuon should:

    <ul>
      <li>be modular;</li>
      <li>work in all browsers;</li>
      <li>be open source;</li>
      <li>be based on web standards;</li>
      <li>have a Matrix-friendly syntax;</li>
      <li>require no server administration;</li>
      <li>share code between contributions;</li>
      <li>compute in the browser;</li>
      <li>encourage exploration (not only explanation);</li>
      <li>have an adaptable workflow.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>A solution</h3>

  <div>

    <div class="left_col">

      We call documents such as this a <b>blab</b>---short for web
      laboratory, like blog is short for web log.  Blabs are typically
      short(ish), <b>modular</b> combinations of text, code and
      plots. 

      Some very simple computation is on the right. You can edit the
      upper(grey) box, press ctrl+enter, and see the results in the
      lower (dashed) box.

      We note that <b>all computation is in the browser</b>, without
      interaction with any server.

    One of Matlab's (and Octave's) great attributes is the way it
    handles matrices. Linear algebra is the cornerstone of applied and
    computational mathematics and an intuitive notation is an
    important first step.
    
    Below we place the computation boxes side-by-side, so that the
    input and outputs correspond along a line. As above, the grey box
    is editable, and is with ctrl+enter.

    After a nice matrix notation, the next thing we need for
    interactive <b>exploration</b> is plotting. In the example below
    we have also exposed a little more programming to create a
    Weierstrass function---the definition of a function (line 4) and a
    cumulative sum (line 6) are easy to follow.

    <div class="left_col">
      <div data-file="weierstrass.coffee"></div>

  Clearly an interactive, computational experience can be delivered in
  the browser (any browser). Less clear is that we are using the same
  technology as web developers. Since we're essentially talking the
  same language, its easy for web developers to contribute. This is a
  major step towards coordinating the different disciplines needed to
  answer the Grand Challenge. It allows us, for instance, to 

  For example, consider the Van der Pol oscillator

  $$ \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}-\mu \left(1-x^2 \right) \frac{dx}{dt} + x =
  0 $$

  <span id = "intro-start-button" class = "text-button">click to
	start</span> <span id = "intro-stop-button" class =
	"text-button">click to stop</span>


  <div id="intro-fig">

    <canvas id="intro-vector-field" class="vector-field"></canvas>

    <div id="intro-oscillator"></div>
    
    <div id = "intro-controls">

      <div id = "intro-checkbox">
	<input type="checkbox" id="persist" value="showSunPhotons">Persistence</input>
