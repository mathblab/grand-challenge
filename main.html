    We respond to [https://twitter.com/MrHonner,@MrHonner]'s
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards,challenge] with a
    combination of open-source and web technologies. Rather than "A
    full-time staff of professional teachers, mathematicians,
    designers, and editors ..." we turn to the latent potential of
    volunteers, and describe how their efforts can be focused.

    While the costs to run Honner's full-time organization would be
    <i>relatively</i> inexpensive (compared to the global costs of
    textbooks say) this is no guarantee of success.  For instance, the
    [http://www.sagemath.org/,Sage] project---a Grand Challenge in its
    own right---has failed to attact significant funding even in the
    face of the overwhelming sum spent on commercial software
    ([http://sagemath.blogspot.com/2014/08/what-is-sagemathcloud-lets-clear-some.html,link]).
    Better to attach, from the outset, the success of the challenge to
    its grass-roots support.

    For inspiration consider the develoment of the Linux kernel, where
    success derives from its strong community.  Students, teachers,
    mathematicians, scientists, engineers, web developers and writers
    should each be able to contrubute to the Grand Challenge
    (according to their interests and abilities) and consume it
    (according to their appetites).

    The technical challenge is to find (and implement) the common
    ground. Any solutiuon should:

    <ul>
      <li>be modular;</li>
      <li>work in all major browsers;</li>
      <li>be
      [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software,free
      and open source];</li>
      <li>be based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards,web standards];</li>
      <li>have a matrix-friendly syntax;</li>
      <li>beautifully present $\LaTeX$: $\left(e^{i\pi}+1=0\right)$</li>
      <li>require zero server administration and costs;</li>
      <li>share and resuse code;</li>
      <li>compute in the browser;</li>
      <li>encourage exploration;</li>
      <li>have an adaptable workflow;</li>
      <li>encourage contribution from many disciplines.</li>
    </ul>

    Below we describe a solution to the Grand Challenge with these
    attributes. In summary, we propose a collection of rich documents
    (of which this is an example), organized as a open-source software
    project ([https://github.com/puzlet/grand-challenge,Fork me on
    GitHub!]).

      We call documents such as this a <b>blab</b>---short for web
      laboratory, like blog is short for web log.  Blabs are typically
      short(ish), <b>modular</b> combinations of text, code and
      plots. 

      A simple example computation is on the right. You can edit the
      upper (grey) box, press ctrl+enter, and see the results in the
      lower (dashed) box.

      Note that <b>all computation is in the browser</b>, without
      interaction with any server.

    One of Matlab's (and Octave's) great attributes is its
    <b>matrix-friendly syntax</b>. Linear algebra is the cornerstone
    of applied and computational mathematics and an intuitive notation
    is an important first step.
    
    Below we place the computation boxes side-by-side, so that the
    input and outputs correspond along a line. As above, the grey box
    is editable, and is executed with ctrl+enter. The syntax is
    similar to Matlab/Octave.

    The next thing we need for interactive <b>exploration</b> is easy
    plotting. In the example below we have also employed a little more
    programming to create a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function,Weierstrass
    function]---the definition of a function (line 4) and a cumulative
    sum (line 6) are easy to follow.

  Clearly interactive computation can be delivered in the browser
  (<b>any browser</b>). Less clear is that we are using the same
  technology as web developers---so its easy for them to contribute. A
  small technical step, but a leap towards coordinating
  the <b>multiple disciplines</b> needed to answer the Grand
  Challenge. Web developers, for instance, are expert in presenting
  technical information in interesting ways---such as the Van der Pol
  oscillator below ($\ddot{x}-\mu(1-x^2)\dot{x}+x=0$). <span id =
  "VdP-start-button" class = "text-button">click to
  start</span> <span id = "VdP-stop-button" class =
  "text-button">click to stop</span>.

  <div id="VdP-fig">

      <div id = "VdP-checkbox">

      </div>

      <input type="range" id="mu-slider" step="0.1" min="0" max="5" value="1"></input>

      <div id="mu-value"></div>

    The guts of a blab is just a collection of files, managed in a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software), git] repository and
    served statically to the browser (<i>statically</i> means without
    any processing by the server). The web application that presents
    these files, and provides all the features of a blab, puzlet.js,
    is itself an [https://github.com/puzlet,open source project].

    This blab is managed by, and served (with <b>zero cost and
    administration</b>) from <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
    (click the "Fork me on GitHub" banner). Blabs can be
    distributed---spanning different repositories, users etc.---and
    <b>share code</b> with each other. For instance, the Van der Pol
    simulation above imports an ODE solver from X.

    For serious development---or just for offline
    viewing---repositories can be cloned to a user's local machine
    (see the "Fork me on GitHub" banner at the top). At a local level
    a user can use whatever tools (editor, GIT client, etc.) they
    choose.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    Some tools for "online" developement (without cloning the
    repository locally) are available and others are being
    developed. Clicking the "Save" button at the top of the page
    creates either a GitHub [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist,
    gist] (for easy sharing) or updates the repository. A gist can
    even be created anonymously (i.e., without a GitHub account).

    Our answer to the Grand Challenge is an open-source project based
    on a collection of blabs. While embryonic, it us more than a
    proposal---we have created an operational GitHub organization,
    [https://github.com/stemweblab,STEMWebLab], in which this blab is
    the first contribution.

    To flourish, STEMWebLab initially needs input from the mathematical
    education community---to help specify missing features, to advise
    on classroom workflow. Ultimately it needs enthusiastic students,
    teachers, mathematicians, scientists, engineers, web developers
    and writers to blab about mathematics.
