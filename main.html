    <b>We respond to [https://twitter.com/MrHonner,@MrHonner]'s
    challenge with a
    combination of open-source and web technologies. </b>
    
    In his challenge Honner imagines "A full-time staff of
    professional teachers, mathematicians, designers, and editors
    ...". Assuming the costs would be minor compared to the amount
    spent yearly on textbooks alone, this is a logical approach.
    However, logic is not always enough.
     
    The [http://www.sagemath.org/,Sage] project is a free rival to
    Mathematica, Matlab etc. In spite of its noble goals, and
    notwithstanding the USD 50 million a year spent just on
    Mathematica, Sage
    [http://sagemath.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/what-is-sagemathcloud-lets-clear-some.html,
    cannot fund even a single full-time developer]. The brutal reality
    is that entrenched industries are difficult to
    disrupt---regardless of logic.

    For inspiration, we look to Wikipedia and Linux. These projects
    rely on loosely-organized, grass-roots volunteers. Each
    contributes according to their interests, abilities and, often, to
    satisfy their own needs. In both cases, the key is to provide an
    environment where contributors from different disciplines can
    focus and multiply their efforts.  We propose that similar
    principles can be applied to the Grand Challenge.

  </div>

  <div class="right_col">

    We feel that the Grand Challenge should be a call to students,
    teachers, mathematicians, scientists, engineers, web developers
    and writers---not to administrators or bureaucrats or
    financiers. To this end we have created a foundation based on the
    following objectives:

    <ul>
      <li>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software,
	free and open source]</li>
      <li>uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and
	JavaScript) and source control (GIT)</li>
      <li>mathematical/scientific computation and interactive 
	plotting/graphics in the browser</li>
      <li>matrix-friendly syntax</li>
      <li>beautifully presents $\LaTeX$</li>
      <li>modular; easy to share and reuse code</li>
      <li>adaptable workflow</li>
      <li>encourages contribution from many disciplines</li>
      <li>allows students to contribute, do homework, etc.</li>
     <li>zero server administration</li>
    </ul>

    In summary, we propose a collection of rich source-controlled
    documents, organized as a open-source software project. Indeed,
    this is the first such document and we explore its capabilities
    below.

    <h3>Web Laboratory---computation in the browser</h3>

    <div class="left_col">

    We call documents such as this a <i>blab</i>---short for web
    laboratory, like blog is short for web log.  Blabs are typically
    short(ish), modular combinations of text, math, code, plots and
    animation.

    A simple example computation is on the right. You can edit the
    upper (grey) box, press <b>shift+enter</b>, and see the results in
    the lower (dashed) box.

    <i>All computation is performed in the browser</i>, without
    interaction with any server.

    <h3>Matrix-friendly syntax</h3>

    One of Matlab's (and Octave's) great attributes is a
    matrix-friendly syntax. Linear algebra is the cornerstone of
    applied and computational mathematics and an intuitive notation is
    important.
    
    Below we place the computation boxes side-by-side, so that the
    input and outputs correspond along a line. As above, the grey box
    is editable, and is executed with shift+enter. The syntax is
    similar to Matlab/Octave.

    <h3>Interactive plotting</h3>

    Straightforward plotting encourages interactive exploration. The
    example below employs a little more <span class="pz_text"
    ref="coffee_note">programming</span> to create a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function,Weierstrass
    function]---the definition of a function (line 4) and a cumulative
    sum (line 6) are easy to follow.

  <h3>Open source, hosted on GitHub</h3>

  The code for this blab resides in a public GitHub
  [https://github.com/mathblab/grand-challenge, repository] which, in
  turn, belongs to the [https://github.com/mathblab, mathblab] GitHub
  organization.  We propose that every blab for the Grand Challenge
  would be such a repository in the mathblab organization.

  The code that runs all blabs (i.e., that processes and presents the
  content) is an open source application, puzlet.js. The app resides
  in another GitHub [https://github.com/puzlet, organization].

  We use GitHub extensively, and some features of puzlet.js rely on
  its API (more on this below). However, the core blab functionality
  can always be realized with plain-old
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software), GIT] and a simple web
  server.

  <br/>

  <br/>

  <h3>Based on standard web technologies</h3>

  Blabs are based on standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and
  JavaScript). This has several advantages: the longevity of a blab is
  not threatened by changing technologies, nor is it tied to the
  fortunes of a specific company, or a particular source of
  funding. Moreover, blabs use the same technology that web developers
  use, and so it is easy for them to contribute.

  Web developers, for instance, are expert in presenting technical
  information in interesting ways. Just for example, consider the Van
  der Pol oscillator, $\ddot{x}-\mu(1-x^2)\dot{x}+x=0~$,
  below. <span id = "VdP-start-button" class = "text-button">click to
  start</span> <span id = "VdP-stop-button" class =
  "text-button">click to stop</span>.

  <div id="VdP-fig">

    <canvas id="VdP-vector-field" class="vector-field"></canvas>

    <div id="VdP-oscillator"></div>
    
    <div id = "VdP-controls">

      <div id = "VdP-checkbox">
	<input type="checkbox" id="persist">Persistence</input>
      </div>

      <input type="range" id="mu-slider" step="0.1" min="0" max="5" value="1"></input>

      <div id="mu-value"></div>
      <div id="mu-label">$\mu$</div>

    </div>
	
    <div id="x-scope" class="scope"></div>
    <div id="y-scope" class="scope"></div>

    <div id="x-label">$\color{green}{x}$</div>
    <div id="y-label">$\color{red}{\dot{x}}$</div>

  </div>

  <br/>

  <br/>

  <h3>Share and reuse code</h3>

  It is easy to share code between blabs. For example, the Van der Pol
  example above imports almost all of its code from
  [http://stemblab.github.io/vanderpol-portrait, another blab] from
  [https://github.com/stemblab, another organization].

  From a development point of view, sharing code has obvious
  advantages---efficiency and reliability are greatly enhanced. Less
  obvious is that it allows a separation of model (which an engineer
  might code) and presentation (which a web developer might code). For
  example, [http://stemblab.github.io/fermi-pasta-ulam/, this blab] on
  the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam paradox imports its presentation from
  [http://stemblab.github.io/mass-spring-vis/, here]. Thus, sharing
  code is another way in which we can make it easy for users from
  various disciplines to contribute to the Grand Challenge.

  <br/>
  <hr/>
  <br/>

  <h3>Adaptable workflow</h3>

  The guts of a blab is a collection of files that the puzlet.js app
  can find, process and present to the user. The authoritative version
  of the files is managed using GIT, and served directly from
  GitHub. However, the files may reside in other places when required.

  For significant editing the files should be pulled to the developer's
  local machine where their favorite tools are available. Modified
  (or new) files can then be pushed back to GitHub in the usual way.
  
  Many times, though, edits to files are never intended to be pushed
  back to the main repository---perhaps they are simple changes in
  parameters to revisit later, or to share with a friend. Or, perhaps
  it is the answer to a homework problem. In these cases a blab's
  files can be saved as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist,
  gist]---either anonymously (without any login whatsoever) or using a
  GitHub account. For example, try making an edit above and then click
  the "save" button.

  <br/>
  <hr/>
  <br/>

  In conclusion, a blab is a collection of source controlled files,
  presented by the puzlet.js application. The open source puzlet.js
  app provides an intuitive mathematical interface and a foundation
  for rich, community-developed technical documents. Being based on
  standard web technologies, a blab can include practically
  [http://puzlet.org/3d-demos/visjs/,any effect] available on the web.

  A collection of blabs, organized as an open-source software project,
  would be free, comprehensive, modular and adaptable. While success
  ultimately rests with a community of volunteers, we propose that
  blabs are an ideal foundation to answer the Grand Challenge.
