    <b>We respond to [https://twitter.com/MrHonner,@MrHonner]'s
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards,challenge] with a
    combination of open-source and web technologies. </b>
    
    In his challenge Honner imagines "A full-time staff of
    professional teachers, mathematicians, designers, and editors
    ...". Assuming the costs would be minor compared to the amount
    spent yearly on textbooks alone, this is a logical approach.
    However, logic is not always enough.
     
    The [http://www.sagemath.org/,Sage] project is a free rival to
    Mathematica, Matlab etc. In spite of its noble goals, and
    notwithstanding the USD 50 million a year spent just on
    Mathematica, Sage
    [http://sagemath.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/what-is-sagemathcloud-lets-clear-some.html,
    cannot fund even a single full-time developer]. The brutal reality
    is that entrenched industries are difficult to
    disrupt---regardless of logic.

    For inspiration, we look to Wikipedia and Linux. These projects
    rely on loosely-organized, grass-roots volunteers. Each
    contributing according to their interests, abilities and, often,
    to satisfy their own needs. In both cases---and also, we propose,
    for the Grand Challenge---the key is to provide an environment
    where contributors from different, but related, disciplines can
    focus and multiply their efforts.

  <div class="right_col">

    We feel that the Grand Challenge should be a call to Students,
    teachers, mathematicians, scientists, engineers, web developers
    and writers --- not to administrators or beurocrats or
    financiers. To this end we have created a foundation for the Grand
    Challenge based around standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and
    Javascript) and source control (GIT) that:

    <ul>
      <li>is modular, and in particular---</li>
      <li>shares and reuses code;</li>
      <li>is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software,free
      and open source];</li>
      <li>has matrix-friendly syntax;</li>
      <li>beautifully presents $\LaTeX$;</li>
      <li>is free to maintain (zero server administration);</li>
      <li>computes in the browser;</li>
      <li>has an adaptable workflow, and in particular---</li>
      <li>allows students to contribute, do homework, etc.;</li>
      <li>encourages contribution from many disciplines.</li>
    </ul>

    In summary, we propose a collection of rich source-controlled
    documents, organized as a open-source software project. Indeed,
    this is the first such document and we explore its capabilities
    below.

      We call documents such as this a <span class="pz_text"
	ref="blab_note">blab</span>---short for web laboratory, like
	blog is short for web log.  Blabs are typically
	short(ish), modular combinations of text, code, plots
	and animation.

      A simple example computation is on the right. You can edit the
      upper (grey) box, press shift+enter, and see the results in the
      lower (dashed) box.

      Note that all computation is within the browser, without
      interaction with any server.

    One of Matlab's (and Octave's) great attributes is a
    matrix-friendly syntax. Linear algebra is the cornerstone of
    applied and computational mathematics and an intuitive notation is
    important.
    
    Below we place the computation boxes side-by-side, so that the
    input and outputs correspond along a line. As above, the grey box
    is editable, and is executed with shift+enter. The syntax is
    similar to Matlab/Octave.

    Straightforward plotting encourages interactive exploration. The

    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weierstrass_function,Weierstrass
    function]---the definition of a function (line 4) and a cumulative
    sum (line 6) are easy to follow.

  The code that defines a blab's content is stored in a
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software), GIT] repository; the
  code for this blab resides in a public GitHub
  [https://github.com/mathblab/grand-challenge, repository]. That
  repository, and we propose, every blab's repository for the Grand
  Challenge, belong to the [https://github.com/mathblab, mathblab]
  GitHub organization.

  The code that runs all blabs (i.e., that processes and presents the
  content) is an open source application, puzlet.js. The app resides
  in another GitHub [https://github.com/puzlet, organization].

  We use GitHub extensively, and some features of puzlet.js rely on
  its API. However, the core blab functionality can always be realized
  with plain-old GIT and a simple web server.

  Blabs are based on standard web technologies (HTML, CSS and
  Javascript). This has several advantages: the longevity of a blab is
  not threatened by changing technologies, nor is it tied to the
  fortunes of a specific company, or a particular source of
  funding. Because blabs use the same technology as web developers it
  is easy for them to contribute.

  Web developers, for instance, are expert in presenting technical
  information in interesting ways. Just for example, consider the Van
  der Pol oscillator, $\ddot{x}-\mu(1-x^2)\dot{x}+x=0~$,
  below. <span id = "VdP-start-button" class = "text-button">click to
  start</span> <span id = "VdP-stop-button" class =
  "text-button">click to stop</span>.

  <div id="VdP-fig">

    <canvas id="VdP-vector-field" class="vector-field"></canvas>

    <div id="VdP-oscillator"></div>
    
    <div id = "VdP-controls">

      <div id = "VdP-checkbox">
	<input type="checkbox" id="persist">Persistence</input>
      </div>

      <input type="range" id="mu-slider" step="0.1" min="0" max="5" value="1"></input>

      <div id="mu-value"></div>
      <div id="mu-label">$\mu$</div>

    </div>
	
    <div id="x-scope" class="scope"></div>
    <div id="y-scope" class="scope"></div>

    <div id="x-label">$\color{green}{x}$</div>
    <div id="y-label">$\color{red}{\dot{x}}$</div>

  </div>

  It is easy to share code between blabs. For example, the Van der Pol
  example above imports almost all of its code from
  [http://stemblab.github.io/vanderpol-portrait, another blab] from
  [http://stemblab.github.io, another organization].

  From a development point of view, sharing code has obvious
  advantages---efficiency and reliability are greatly enhanced. Less
  obvious is that it allows a separation of model (which an engineer
  might code) and presentation (which a web developer might code). For
  example, [http://stemblab.github.io/fermi-pasta-ulam/, this blab] on
  the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam paradox, imports its presentation from
  [http://stemblab.github.io/mass-spring-vis/, here]. Thus, sharing
  code is another way in which we can make it easy for users from
  various disciplines to contribute to the Grand Challenge.

  <br/>

  <br/>

  The guts of a blab is a collection of files that the puzlet.js app
  can find, process and present to the user. The authorative version
  of the files is managed using GIT, and served directly from
  GitHub. However, the files may reside in other places when required.

  For significant editing the files should be pulled to the devloper's
  local machine where their favourite tools are available. Modified
  (or new) files can then be pushed back to GitHub in the usual way.
  
  Many times, though, edits to files are never intended to be pushed
  back to the main repository---perhaps they are simple changes in
  parameters to revisit later, or to share with a friend. Or, perhaps
  it is the answer to a homework problem. In these cases a blab's
  files can be saved as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Gist,
  gist]---either anonymously (without any login whatsoever) or using a
  github account. For example, try making an edit above and then click
  the "save" button.

  <br/>
  <hr/>
  <br/>

  In conclusion, a blab is a collection of source controlled files,
  presented by the puzlet.js application. The open source pulzet.js
  app provides an intuitive mathematical interface and a foundation
  for rich, community-devloped technical documents. Being based on
  standard web technologies, a blab can include practically
  [http://puzlet.org/3d-demos/visjs/,any effect] available on the web.

  A collection of blabs, organized as an open-source software project,
  would be free, comprehensive, modular and adaptable. While sucess
  ultimately rests with a community of volunteers, we propose that
  blabs are an ideal foundation to answer the Grand Challenge.
