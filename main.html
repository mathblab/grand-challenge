  <h2>Rising to Mr Honner's Grand Challenge</h2>

  ["Build and maintain a free, comprehensive, modular, and adaptable
  repository of learning materials for all secondary mathematics
  content."]

  <div class="left_col">
    
    The key to realizing Mr Honners Grand Challenge is:

    [" A full-time staff of professional teachers, mathematicians,
    designers, and editors ..."]

    While the costs would be minor compared to the global costs of
    textbooks---even for a large staff---this is no guarantee of
    success. For instance, the Sage project---at least as grand in
    outlook---has failed to attact significant funding even in the
    face of the overwhelming sum spent on commercial software
    ([http://sagemath.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/what-is-sagemathcloud-lets-clear-some.html,link]).

    Furthermore, even with funding, it is arguable that this is not
    the best model. The life of such a project will *always* be
    precarious --- from budget to budget --- as financial and
    political winds change. Better to accept, from the outset, that
    the success depends on grass-roots support.

    The question, then, is not how to attract funding---but how to
    organize the people that are willing to help for free. For
    inspiration consider the develoment of the Linux kernal. Certainly
    there are commercial aspects to Linux---but its continuing success
    has grown from its volunteer community. Furthermore, it is not a
    great leap to recognise in the Linux community---and the broader
    open-source sofware community---the same types of people that
    would be willing to rise to Mr Honners Grand Challenge.

    The leading players are:

    <ul>
      <li>Students</li>
      <li>Teachers</li>
      <li>Mathematicians</li>
      <li>Scientists and Engineers</li>
      <li>Web developers</li>
      <li>Writers</li>
    </ul>

    The technical challenge is to find the common ground for these six
    roles---where all can contribute (according to their abilities)
    and consume (according to their appetites).
